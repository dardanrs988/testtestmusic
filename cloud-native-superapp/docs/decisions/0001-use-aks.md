# 1. Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for Container Orchestration

Date: 2024-01-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a robust, scalable, and managed platform to run our containerized applications (frontend and backend). The platform must support automated deployments, scaling, and provide a high degree of reliability.

## Decision

We will use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as our container orchestration platform.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Managed Control Plane**: Azure manages the Kubernetes control plane, reducing our operational overhead.
- **Integration with Azure Services**: AKS integrates seamlessly with other Azure services like Azure Active Directory, Azure Monitor, and Azure Policy.
- **Scalability**: Provides robust autoscaling capabilities for both nodes and pods.
- **Strong Community and Ecosystem**: Kubernetes is the industry standard with a vast ecosystem of tools and a large community.

### Negative:
- **Complexity**: Kubernetes has a steep learning curve.
- **Cost**: While the control plane is free, the worker nodes incur costs. Managing costs requires careful planning of resource requests and limits.
