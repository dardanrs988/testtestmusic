# Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the Cloud-Native SuperApp.

## Guiding Principles

- **Scalability**: The system is designed to handle varying loads by leveraging cloud-native features like autoscaling.
- **Resilience**: Services are designed to be fault-tolerant and resilient to failures.
- **Security**: Security is a primary concern, with measures implemented at every layer (IaC, network, application).
- **Observability**: The system is designed to be observable, with comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing.

## Components

1.  **Frontend**: A Next.js application served via Server-Side Rendering (SSR). It is responsible for the user interface and interacts with the backend API.

2.  **Backend**: A FastAPI service that exposes a RESTful API. It contains the core business logic, interacts with the database, and communicates with other services.

3.  **Infrastructure (Azure)**: The entire infrastructure is managed as code using Terraform. Key components include:
    - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: For container orchestration.
    - **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: To store Docker images.
    - **Azure Key Vault**: For secure secret management.
    - **Azure Database**: For persistent data storage.
    - **Azure Front Door**: As a global load balancer and WAF.

4.  **Kubernetes (k8s)**:
    - Application deployments are managed via Helm charts.
    - Kustomize is used to manage environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod).
    - The cluster includes platform services like `ingress-nginx` for ingress, `cert-manager` for TLS, and the `prometheus-stack` for monitoring.

5.  **CI/CD**:
    - GitHub Actions are used for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
    - A GitOps workflow with Argo CD is planned for managing Kubernetes deployments.
